This code defines an actor that manages a file tree using TrieMap. The file tree consists of folders and files, where each folder can have multiple files. The implementation provides methods to add folders and files to the tree and browse the tree content.

Key components of the code:

Imports: The code imports the necessary modules like TrieMap, Text, Blob, List, and Iter.
Type definitions:
File: A record type representing a file with name and content.
Folder: A record type representing a folder with a name and a list of files.
FileTree: A TrieMap with keys of type Text and values of type Folder.
Result: A variant type representing a result, which can either be Ok with a value or an error message.
Functions customHash and customEq: These are helper functions for defining a custom hash function and equality function for Text.
Variable fileTree: This is the main TrieMap structure that stores the folders and their content.
Methods:
addFolder: Takes a folder name as input and creates a new folder with that name.
addFile: Takes a folder name, file name, and content as input, and adds the file to the specified folder. Returns a Result type indicating success or error.
browse: This shared function returns a list of all the entries in the file tree.
This actor can be used to manage a file system-like structure using TrieMap, allowing for the addition of folders and files, as well as browsing the contents of the tree.
